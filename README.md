# README

This repository includes the scripts and supplementary data needed to
reproduce the analysis and slide deck for the presentation

> Wheeler, Jonathan and Ngoc-Minh Pham (2023). "Assessing the Global Divide:
Repository access from the global north and south, before and after COVID."
Presented to the Open Repositories conference, Stellanbosch, South Africa,
June 13, 2023.

Additional documentation is provided in each script. Note that raw RAMP
data must be downloaded separately, as describe in the script
'aggregate_raw_RAMP_data.py.'

To run the code and analysis:

1. Download the RAMP data.
2. Run scripts/aggregate_raw_RAMP_data.py

To reproduce the slide deck (PDF) from the presentation, compile or 'knit'
the file "scripts/open_repositories2023.Rmd."

To view the analysis and plots without generating the slides, or to view
some additional plots and descriptive tables not included in the slides,
run "scripts/or23_analysis.R"
